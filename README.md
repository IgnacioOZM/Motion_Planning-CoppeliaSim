# Motion_Planning-CoppeliaSim
This project will focus on the creation of a motion planning algorithm to manoeuvre
the robot pioneer p3dx.The map and the position of the robot will be known and the objective
is to be able to control the robots position and to reach a destination in the shortest
time possible while avoiding collisions with walls and obstacles.

* Understand how search works in discrete space.
* Build an admissible heuristic for any goal location.
* Program the A* search algorithm.
* Convert the output of A* into a path and smooth the resulting trajectory.

A* and heuristic function:
